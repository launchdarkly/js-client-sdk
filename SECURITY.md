# Reporting and Fixing Security Issues

Please report all security issues to the LaunchDarkly security team by submitting a bug bounty report to our [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/launchdarkly?type=team). LaunchDarkly will triage and address all valid security issues following the response targets defined in our program policy. Valid security issues may be eligible for a bounty.

Please do not open issues or pull requests for security issues. This makes the problem immediately visible to everyone, including potentially malicious actors.

# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK will be documented in this file. 
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [2.1.2] - 2018-06-08
### Fixed:
- Fix the TypeScript definitions to properly support the ES default export.

## [2.1.1] - 2018-06-05
### Fixed:
- Removed two function calls that are not supported in Internet Explorer: `string.startsWith()` and `Object.assign()`.

## [2.1.0] - 2018-05-31
### Added:
- The client now sends the current SDK version to LaunchDarkly in an HTTP header. This information will be visible in a future version of the LaunchDarkly UI.

### Fixed:
- Fixed a bug that caused summary events to combine the counts for flag evaluations that produced the flag's first variation (variation index 0) with the counts for flag evaluations that fell through to the default value.

## [2.0.0] - 2018-05-25
### Changed
- To reduce the network bandwidth used for analytics events, feature request events are now sent as counters rather than individual events, and user details are now sent only at intervals rather than in each event. These behaviors can be modified through the LaunchDarkly UI and with the new configuration option `inlineUsersInEvents`. For more details, see [Analytics Data Stream Reference](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/v2.0/docs/analytics-data-stream-reference).
- In every function that takes an optional callback parameter, if you provide a callback, the function will not return a promise; a promise will be returned only if you omit the callback. Previously, it would always return a promise which would be resolved/rejected at the same time that the callback (if any) was called; this caused problems if you had not registered an error handler for the promise.
- When sending analytics events, if there is a connection error or an HTTP 5xx response, the client will try to send the events again one more time after a one-second delay.
- Analytics are now sent with an HTTP `POST` request if the browser supports CORS, or via image loading if it does not. Previously, they were always sent via image loading.

### Added
- The new configuration option `sendEventsOnlyForVariation`, if set to `true`, causes analytics events for feature flags to be sent only when you call `variation`. Otherwise, the default behavior is to also send events when you call `allFlags`, and whenever a changed flag value is detected in streaming mode.
- The new configuration option `allowFrequentDuplicateEvents`, if set to `true`, turns off throttling for feature flag events. Otherwise, the default behavior is to block the sending of an analytics event if another event with the same flag key, flag value, and user key was generated within the last five minutes.

### Fixed
- If `identify` is called with a null user, or a user with no key, the function no longer tries to do an HTTP request to the server (which would always fail); instead, it just returns an error.

### Deprecated
- The configuration options `all_attributes_private` and `private_attribute_names` are deprecated. Use `allAttributesPrivate` and `privateAttributeNames` instead.

## [1.7.4] - 2018-05-23
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that caused events _not_ to be sent if `options.sendEvents` was explicitly set to `true`.
- HTTP requests will no longer fail if there is a `charset` specified in the response's `Content-Type` header. ([#87](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client/issues/87))

## [1.7.3] - 2018-05-08
### Fixed
- The client no longer creates an empty `XMLHttpRequest` at startup time (which could interfere with unit tests).

## [1.7.2] - 2018-05-07
_This release was broken and should not be used._

## [1.7.1] - 2018-05-07
_This release was broken and should not be used._

## [1.7.0] - 2018-04-27
### Changed
- The build now uses Rollup, Babel and Jest.
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that caused a syntax error when running in Internet Explorer 11.
- Fixed an IE 11 incompatibility in the example page index.html.
- Fixed a bug that caused the SDK to send events on beforeunload even if it should not send events.


## [1.6.2] - 2018-04-05

### Fixed

* `LDClient.track` properly sets the user for custom events.

## [1.6.1] - 2018-03-30

### Fixed

* The SDK now polls the URL for changes if (and only if) there are page view goals,to ensure it is accurately reporting page views.

## [1.6.0] - 2018-03-28

### Changed

* Added support for a future update to LaunchDarkly that will deliver individual feature flag changes over the streaming connection as they occur, rather than requiring the client to re-request all flags for each change.

## [1.5.2] - 2018-03-28

### Added

* The new flush method on the client object tells the client to deliver any stored analytics events as soon as possible, rather than waiting for the regularly scheduled event-flushing interval.
  ### Fixed
* Fixed a bug that could prevent events from being generated for page view goals.

## [1.5.1] - 2018-03-07

### Fixed

* Removed usage of the `const` keyword, to maintain IE10 compatibility. (Thanks, [turnerniles](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client/pull/68)!)

## [1.5.0] - 2018-03-05

### Added

* The `options` object now supports a `samplingInterval` property. If greater than zero, this causes a fraction of analytics events to be sent to LaunchDarkly: one per that number of events (pseudo-randomly). For instance, setting it to 5 would cause 20% of events to be sent on average.

## [1.4.0] - 2018-02-07

### Added

* The SDK now supports multiple environments. Calling `initialize` returns a new client each time.
  ### Fixed
* The `waitUntilReady` `Promise` will now resolve even after the `ready` event was emitted — thanks @rmanalan!

## [1.3.1] - 2018-01-23

### Fixed

* Methods that expose a `Promise` interface now properly return the resolution or rejection value to the caller.

## [1.3.0] - 2018-01-22

### Added

* Support for [private user attributes](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/private-user-attributes).
* New `sendEvents` option to control whether the SDK should send events back to LaunchDarkly or not. Defaults to `true`.
* It is now possible to wait for SDK readiness using `waitUntilReady` which returns a `Promise`. `identify` also returns a `Promise` (while still supporting the callback argument), which should make
  it easier to integrate into code that relies heavily on `Promise`'s for asynchronous code.
  ### Changed
* The SDK now respects the user's [do-not-track setting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/doNotTrack)

## [1.2.0] - 2017-12-15

### Added

* Added `useReport` initialization option to use `REPORT` instead of `GET` when communicating with LaunchDarkly.
  ### Fixed
* Authentication errors will now be logged — the root cause for these errors is usually an invalid
  client-side ID.

## [1.1.13] - 2017-12-12

### Changed

* Emit an `error` event — separately from the `ready` event — in case fetching initial data fails. This allows consumers to respond accordingly.

## [1.1.12] - 2017-06-09

### Changed

* Improve error handling

## [1.1.11] - 2017-05-16

### Added

* Add typescript definitions

## [1.1.10] - 2017-05-04

### Added

## [1.1.9] - 2017-04-07

### Fixed

* Changed default stream url

## [1.1.8] - 2017-02-02

### Fixed

* Cached `localStorage` copy is not overwritten anymore when connection to LD
  fails

## [1.1.7] - 2017-01-27

### Changed

* `onDone` argument to `identify` method is now optional

## [1.1.6] - 2017-01-16

### Changed

* Removed dependency on Sizzle and direct to polyfill for older browser support

## [1.1.5] - 2016-12-07

### Changed

* Fix bug caused by accessing `undefined` settings

## [1.1.2] - 2016-09-21

## [1.1.1] - 2016-09-20

### Changed

* Fix flag setting request cancellation logic

## [1.1.0] - 2016-09-14

### Added

* Add a new `allFlags` method that returns a map of all feature flag keys and
  their values for a user

## [1.0.8] - 2016-09-09

### Changed

* Added 'undefined' check on VERSION otherwise unbundled usage from npm fails

## [1.0.7] - 2016-09-06

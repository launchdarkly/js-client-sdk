  /**
   * Provides a simple [[LDLogger]] implementation.
   *
   * This logging implementation uses a simple format that includes only the log level
   * and the message text. By default, output is written to `console` methods (`console.info`
   * for normal informational messages, `console.warn` for warnings, `console.error` for
   * errors, and `console.log` for debug output) and the default minimum level is `info`
   * (that is, debug output is suppressed). You can filter by log level or change the output
   * destination with [[BasicLoggerOptions]].
   *
   * To use the logger created by this function, put it into [[LDOptions.logger]]. If
   * you do not set [[LDOptions.logger]] to anything, the SDK uses a default logger
   * that is equivalent to `ld.basicLogger({ level: 'info' })`.
   *
   * @param options Configuration for the logger. If no options are specified, the
   *   logger uses `{ level: 'info' }`.
   * 
   * @example
   * This example shows how to use `basicLogger` in your SDK options to enable console
   * logging only at `warn` and `error` levels.
   * ```javascript
   *   const ldOptions = {
   *     logger: ld.basicLogger({ level: 'warn' }),
   *   };
   * ```
